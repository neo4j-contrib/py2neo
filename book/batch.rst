==========
API: Batch
==========

The Neo4j batch resource is designed to allow multiple REST calls to be passed to the server in a
single request and be executed in a single transaction. While this remains a good choice for some
legacy use cases, many are better served by a `Cypher transaction <py2neo.cypher.Transaction>`_
instead.

Batches offer a limited capability to refer to one job from another **within the same batch**. This
can be useful when building a batch that creates both nodes and relationships between those new
nodes. Note though that certain combinations of such cross-referencing are not possible,
particularly when creating nodes within a legacy index.

Labels and schema indexes are also poorly supported by the batch facility and it is recommended to
use Cypher transactions instead when working with these.
