Py2neo
======

Py2neo is a simple and pragmatic Python library that provides access to the
popular graph database Neo4j via its RESTful web service interface. With no
external dependencies, installation is straightforward and getting started
with coding is easy. The library is actively maintained on GitHub, regularly
updated in the Python Package Index and is built uniquely for Neo4j in close
association with its team and community.

.. note::
   Some preparation has been made for support of node labels, available in
   Neo4j 2.0. However, no features have yet been implemented in py2neo to make
   any label functionality available to client applications.

.. warning::
   A significant number of features have been deprecated in py2neo 1.5. See
   `here <deprecated_features.html>`_ for details.
