py2neo
=======

The py2neo project provides bindings between Python and Neo4j via its RESTful
web service interface. It attempts to be both Pythonic and consistent with the
core Neo4j API.

Source code: https://github.com/nigelsmall/py2neo


Version 0.97
-------------

- Updated geoff.py loader to read relationship index entries

Version 0.96
-------------

- More batch operations added (see http://py2neo.org/batch for details)
- Lots of refactoring

Version 0.95
-------------

- New complete application example added: PynIT!
- Added encoding for indexes to allow slashes in values
- Added get_xxx_index to allow automatic creation of non-existant indexes

Version 0.94
-------------

- Added HTTP authentication options (user name & password)

Version 0.93
-------------

- Added GraphDatabaseService.get_subreference_node() method
- Added index entry support to GEOFF files

Version 0.92
-------------

- PersistentObject class introduced with new example file example2.py

Version 0.91
-------------

- Fixed small bug in Path class
- Added GraphDatabaseService.create_nodes() method to add a batch of nodes in
  a single transaction

Version 0.9
------------

PLEASE NOTE THAT v0.9 IS NOT FULLY BACKWARD COMPATIBLE WITH v0.8 (This applies
primarily to Path and Traverser objects which are now more in-sync with Neo4j
Java API)

- Changes to method and property signatures to bring into line with Java API
- Path class renamed and changed to use properties instead of methods
- Traverser class completely rewritten and new TraversalDescription class
- Updated README and example1.py with new sample code
- Added method get_id to IndexableResource
- Added methods get_type, is_type and get_nodes to Relationship class
- Added get_single_* methods to Node class
