``py2neo.data`` -- Graph data types
***********************************

.. module:: py2neo.data

.. note:: For convenience, the members of ``py2neo.data`` can also be imported directly from ``py2neo``.

**Py2neo** provides a rich set of data types for working with both graph and record-based data.
The graph types are completely compatible with Neo4j but can also be used independently.
They include the fundamental entities :class:`.Node` and :class:`.Relationship` as well as classes that represent collections of these entities.

Graph data classes have been designed to work together using standard operations, most notably set operations.
Details of these operations are covered in the sections on :ref:`subgraphs` and :ref:`walkable_types`.



:class:`.Node` and :class:`.Relationship` objects
=================================================

The two essential building blocks of the labelled property graph model used by Neo4j are the :class:`.Node` and the :class:`.Relationship`.
The node is the fundamental unit of data storage within a graph.
It can contain a set of key-value pairs (properties) and can optionally be adorned with one or more textual labels.
A relationship is a typed, directed connection between a pair of nodes (or alternatively a `loop <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_%28graph_theory%29>`_ on a single node).
Like nodes, relationships may also contain a set of properties.

The code below shows how to create a couple of nodes and a relationship joining them.
Each node has a single property, `name`, and is labelled as a `Person`.
The relationship ``ab`` describes a `KNOWS` connection from the first node ``a`` to the second node ``b``.

::

    >>> from py2neo.data import Node, Relationship
    >>> a = Node("Person", name="Alice")
    >>> b = Node("Person", name="Bob")
    >>> ab = Relationship(a, "KNOWS", b)
    >>> ab
    (Alice)-[:KNOWS]->(Bob)


.. class:: Node(*labels, **properties)

    Construct a new node object with the labels and properties specified.
    In its initial state, a node is `unbound`.
    This means that it exists only on the client and does not reference a corresponding server node.
    A node is typically `bound` by :meth:`creating <.GraphTransaction.create>` it in a Neo4j database.

    .. describe:: node == other

        Return ``True`` if *node* and *other* are equal.
        Node equality is based solely on the ID of the remote node it represents; neither properties nor labels factor into equality.
        This means that if `bound`, a node object can only be considered equal to another node object that is bound to the same remote node.
        If a node is `unbound`, thereby having no corresponding node ID, it can only ever be equal to itself.

    .. describe:: node != other

        Return ``True`` if the nodes are unequal.

    .. describe:: hash(node)

        Return a hash of *node* based on its object ID, if unbound, or the ID of the remote node it represents, if bound.

    .. describe:: node[key]

        Return the property value of *node* with key *key* or ``None`` if the key is missing.

    .. describe:: node[key] = value

        Set the property value of *node* with key *key* to *value* or remove the property if *value* is ``None``.

    .. describe:: del node[key]

        Remove the property with key *key* from *node*, raising a :exc:`KeyError` if such a property does not exist.

    .. describe:: len(node)

        Return the number of properties in *node*.

    .. describe:: dict(node)

        Return a dictionary of all the properties in *node*.

    .. describe:: walk(node)

        Yield *node* as the only item in a :func:`walk`.

    .. attribute:: node.labels

        Return the full set of labels associated with *node*.
        This set is immutable and cannot be used to add or remove labels.

    .. method:: node.has_label(label)

        Return :const:`True` if *node* has the label *label*.

    .. method:: node.add_label(label)

        Add the label *label* to *node*.

    .. method:: node.remove_label(label)

        Remove the label *label* from *node*, raising a :exc:`ValueError` if it does not exist.

    .. method:: node.clear_labels()

        Remove all labels from *node*.

    .. method:: node.update_labels(labels)

        Add multiple labels to *node* from the iterable *labels*.

    .. attribute:: node.graph

        The remote graph to which *node* is bound, if any.

    .. attribute:: node.identity

        The ID of the remote node to which *node* is bound, if any.

.. class:: Relationship(start_node, type, end_node, **properties)
           Relationship(start_node, end_node, **properties)
           Relationship(node, type, **properties)
           Relationship(node, **properties)

    Construct a relationship between a pair of nodes (or between a node and itself) of type *type*.
    If the type is not specified, it will default to ``TO``.
    This default can be overridden by extending the ``Relationship`` class::

        >>> c = Node("Person", name="Carol")
        >>> class WorksWith(Relationship): pass
        >>> ac = WorksWith(a, c)
        >>> type(ac)
        'WORKS_WITH'

    .. describe:: relationship == other

        Return ``True`` if *relationship* and *other* are equal.
        Relationship equality is based on equality of the start node, the end node and the relationship type (node equality is described above).
        This means that any two relationships of the same type between the same nodes are always considered equal.
        Note that this behaviour differs slightly from Neo4j itself which permits multiple relationships of the same type between the same nodes.

    .. describe:: relationship != other

        Return ``True`` if the relationships are unequal.

    .. describe:: hash(relationship)

        Return a hash of *relationship* based on its start node, end node and type.

    .. describe:: relationship[key]

        Return the property value of *relationship* with key *key* or ``None`` if the key is missing.

    .. describe:: relationship[key] = value

        Set the property value of *relationship* with key *key* to *value* or remove the property
        if *value* is ``None``.

    .. describe:: del relationship[key]

        Remove the property with key *key* from *relationship*, raising a :exc:`KeyError` if such a property does not exist.

    .. describe:: len(relationship)

        Return the number of properties in *relationship*.

    .. describe:: dict(relationship)

        Return a dictionary of all the properties in *relationship*.

    .. describe:: walk(relationship)

        Perform a :func:`walk` of this relationship, yielding its start node, the relationship itself and its end node in turn.

    .. describe:: type(relationship)

        Return the type of this relationship.

    .. attribute:: relationship.graph

        The remote graph to which *relationship* is bound, if any.

    .. attribute:: relationship.identity

        The ID of the remote relationship to which *relationship* is bound, if any.


Both :class:`.Node` and :class:`.Relationship` extend the :class:`.PropertyDict` class which itself extends Python's built-in dictionary.
This means that nodes and relationships are both mapping types that can contain property values, indexed by key.

As with Neo4j itself, property values may not be ``None``.
A missing property (i.e. no key present) is the idiomatic way to model absence of value.

The *PropertyDict* class is described in more detail below.

.. class:: PropertyDict(iterable, **kwargs)

    The *PropertyDict* extends Python's built-in *dict* type.
    All operations and methods are identical to those of its base class except for those described below.

    .. describe:: properties == other

        Return ``True`` if ``properties`` is equal to ``other`` after all ``None`` values have been removed from ``other``.

    .. describe:: properties != other

        Return ``True`` if ``properties`` is unequal to ``other`` after all ``None`` values have been removed from ``other``.

    .. describe:: properties[key]

        Return the value of *properties* with key *key* or ``None`` if the key is missing.

    .. describe:: properties[key] = value

        Set the value of *properties* with key *key* to *value* or remove the property if *value* is ``None``.

    .. method:: setdefault(key, default=None)

        If *key* is in the PropertyDict, return its value.
        If not, insert *key* with a value of *default* and return *default* unless *default* is ``None``, in which case do nothing.
        The value of *default* defaults to ``None``.

    .. method:: update(iterable=None, **kwargs)

        Update the PropertyDict with the key-value pairs from *iterable* followed by the keyword arguments from *kwargs*.
        Individual properties already in the PropertyDict will be overwritten by those in *iterable* and subsequently by those in *kwargs* if the keys match.
        Any value of ``None`` will effectively delete the property with that key, should it exist.


.. _subgraphs:

:class:`.Subgraph` objects
==========================

A :class:`.Subgraph` is an arbitrary collection of nodes and relationships.
By definition, a *Subgraph* must contain at least one node; `null subgraphs <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NullGraph.html>`_ should be represented by :const:`None`.
To test for `emptiness <http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EmptyGraph.html>`_ the built-in :func:`bool` function can be used.

The simplest way to construct a subgraph is by combining nodes and relationships using standard set operations.
For example::

    >>> s = ab | ac
    >>> s
    {(alice:Person {name:"Alice"}),
     (bob:Person {name:"Bob"}),
     (carol:Person {name:"Carol"}),
     (Alice)-[:KNOWS]->(Bob),
     (Alice)-[:WORKS_WITH]->(Carol)}
    >>> s.nodes()
    frozenset({(alice:Person {name:"Alice"}),
               (bob:Person {name:"Bob"}),
               (carol:Person {name:"Carol"})})
    >>> s.relationships()
    frozenset({(Alice)-[:KNOWS]->(Bob),
               (Alice)-[:WORKS_WITH]->(Carol)})


.. class:: Subgraph(nodes, relationships)

    A *Subgraph* is an immutable set of nodes and relationships that can be provided as an argument to many graph database functions.
    It is also the base class for :class:`.Node`, :class:`.Relationship` and :class:`.Walkable`, allowing instances of those classes to be combined using set operations.

    .. describe:: subgraph | other | ...

        Union.
        Return a new subgraph containing all nodes and relationships from *subgraph* as well as all those from *other*.
        Any entities common to both will only be included once.

    .. describe:: subgraph & other & ...

        Intersection.
        Return a new subgraph containing all nodes and relationships common to both *subgraph* and *other*.

    .. describe:: subgraph - other - ...

        Difference.
        Return a new subgraph containing all nodes and relationships that exist in *subgraph* but do not exist in *other*,
        as well as all nodes that are connected by the relationships in *subgraph* regardless of whether or not they exist in *other*.

    .. describe:: subgraph ^ other ^ ...

        Symmetric difference.
        Return a new subgraph containing all nodes and relationships that exist in *subgraph* or *other*, but not in both,
        as well as all nodes that are connected by those relationships regardless of whether or not they are common to *subgraph* and *other*.

    .. method:: subgraph.keys

        Return the set of all property keys used by the nodes and relationships in this subgraph.

    .. attribute:: subgraph.labels

        Return the set of all node labels in this subgraph.

    .. attribute:: subgraph.nodes

        Return the set of all nodes in this subgraph.

    .. attribute:: subgraph.relationships

        Return the set of all relationships in this subgraph.

    .. method:: subgraph.types

        Return the set of all relationship types in this subgraph.


.. _walkable_types:

:class:`.Path` objects and other :class:`.Walkable` types
=========================================================

A :class:`.Walkable` is a :class:`.Subgraph` with added traversal information
The simplest way to construct a walkable is to concatenate other graph objects::

    >>> w = ab + Relationship(b, "LIKES", c) + ac
    >>> w
    (Alice)-[:KNOWS]->(Bob)-[:LIKES]->(Carol)<-[:WORKS_WITH]-(Alice)

The traversal of a walkable object is achieved by using the :func:`walk` function, which yields alternating nodes and relationships and always starts and ends with a node.
Any node or relationship may be traversed one or more times in any direction.

.. class:: Walkable(iterable)

    A *Walkable* is a :class:`.Subgraph` with added traversal information.

    .. describe:: walkable + other + ...

        Concatenation.
        Return a new :class:`.Walkable` that represents a :func:`walk` of `walkable` followed by a :func:`walk` of `other`.
        This is only possible if the end node of `walkable` is the same as either the start node or the end node of `other`;
        in the latter case, `other` will be walked in reverse.

        Nodes that overlap from one operand onto another are not duplicated in the returned :class:`.Walkable`.

    .. describe:: walk(walkable)

        Perform a :func:`walk` of *walkable*, yielding alternating nodes and relationships.

    .. describe:: start_node

        Return the first node encountered on a :func:`walk` of this object.

    .. describe:: end_node

        Return the last node encountered on a :func:`walk` of this object.

    .. describe:: nodes

        Return a tuple of all nodes traversed on a :func:`walk` of this :class:`.Walkable`, listed in the order in which they were first encountered.

    .. describe:: relationships

        Return a tuple of all relationships traversed on a :func:`walk` of this :class:`.Walkable`, listed in the order in which they were first encountered.

.. class:: Path(*entities)

    A *Path* is a type of :class:`.Walkable` returned by some Cypher queries.

.. function:: walk(*walkables)

    Traverse over the arguments supplied, in order, yielding alternating nodes and relationships.
