"""
This module provides an implementation of the Python Database API v2.0
(as specified in PEP 249) for Neo4j. The classes here are thin wrappers
over the regular py2neo functionality, so will provide a very similar
behaviour and experience to the rest of the library.

To get started, create a :class:`Connection` object using the
:func:`connect` function::

>>> from py2neo.pep249 import connect
>>> con = connect()

The arguments accepted by this function are identical to those accepted
by the :class:`.Graph` class in the core API. Therefore, a URI and any
combination of individual settings may be specified.

The :class:`Connection` object represents a single
client-server connection and can maintain a single transaction at any
point in time. Transactions are implicitly created through using a
method like :meth:`Cursor.execute` or can be explicitly
created using the :meth:`Connection.begin` method.
