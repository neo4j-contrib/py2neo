    However, any number of labels and any condition supported by the
    Cypher `WHERE` clause is allowed.

    For a simple selection by label and property::

    For a more comprehensive selection using Cypher expressions, the

    refinement. Here, the underscore character can be used to refer to
    the node being filtered::

        >>> selected = selector.select("Person").where("_.name =~ 'J.*'", "1960 <= _.born < 1970")
        >>> list(selected)

         (e40244b:Person {born:1967,name:"Julia Roberts"})]

    The underlying query is only evaluated when the selection undergoes
    iteration or when a specific evaluation method is called (such as
    :meth:`.NodeSelection.first`). This means that a :class:`.NodeSelection`
