Py2neo v3
=========

Py2neo is a client library and toolkit for working with Neo4j from within Python applications and from the command line.
The core library has no external dependencies and has been carefully designed to be easy and intuitive to use.


Installation
------------

To install the latest stable version of py2neo, simply use pip::

```
$ pip install py2neo
```

To install the latest bleeding edge code directly from GitHub, use::

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/nigelsmall/py2neo.git#egg=py2neo
```

Note that this code is likely to be unstable.
Your mileage may vary.


Requirements
------------

The following versions of Python and Neo4j are supported:

- Python 2.7 / 3.3 / 3.4 / 3.5 / 3.6
- Neo4j 2.0 / 2.1 / 2.2 / 2.3 / 3.0 / 3.1 (the latest point release of each version is recommended)

Note also that Py2neo is developed and tested exclusively under Linux using standard CPython distributions.
While other operating systems and Python distributions may work, support for these is not available.
