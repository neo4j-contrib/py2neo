= Py2neo

The py2neo project provides bindings between Python and Neo4j via its RESTful web service interface. It attempts to be both //Pythonic// and consistent with the core Neo4j API.

In addition, the project provides support for the Graph Export Object File Format (Geoff). For further information on Geoff, visit [[http://geoff.nigelsmall.net/]].

== Requirements

Py2neo has been built against the following software:

* Python 2.6+ <[[http://python.org/]]>
* Neo4j 1.6+ <[[http://neo4j.org/]]>

Earlier versions of these may work but are not guaranteed to do so.

== Installation

The easiest way to install py2neo is from the Python Package Index (PyPI), using pip:

{{{
sudo pip install py2neo
}}}

Alternatively, you may prefer to use the latest code directly from GitHub:

{{{
git clone git@github.com:nigelsmall/py2neo.git
}}}

== Getting Started

The following short programme illustrates a simple usage of the py2neo library:

<<code lang="python">>
{{{
#!/usr/bin/env python

"""
Simple example showing node and relationship creation plus
execution of Cypher queries
"""

from __future__ import print_function

# Import Neo4j modules
from py2neo import neo4j, cypher

# Attach to the graph db instance
graph_db = neo4j.GraphDatabaseService("http://localhost:7474/db/data/")

# Create two nodes
node_a, node_b = graph_db.create(
    {"name": "Alice"},
    {"name": "Bob"}
)

# Join the nodes with a relationship
rel_ab = node_a.create_relationship_to(node_b, "KNOWS")

# Build a Cypher query
query = "START a=node({A}) MATCH a-[:KNOWS]->b RETURN a,b"

# Define a row handler...
def print_row(row):
    a, b = row
    print(a["name"] + " knows " + b["name"])

# ...and execute the query
cypher.execute(graph_db, query, {"A": node_a.id}, row_handler=print_row)
}}}
