"""
This module creates a random graph of a specified size that has
characteristics of a simple social network. For the size given, that
many nodes will be created with random properties; a similar (slightly
smaller) number of relationships will also be created, the number
differing due to the use of CREATE UNIQUE and the chance of clashes.
Creation of nodes and relationships alternates.

The main aim of this module is to allow exploration of varying
transaction and process batch size to see its effect on overall load
time. Each run consists of a number of transactions of `tx_size`
statements, each of which will send a batch of statements to the
server for processing every `rq_size` statements. Therefore, for a
total size of 1_200_000 nodes, a transaction size of 20_000 and a
process interval of 1_000, 60 transactions will be committed, each
over 20 individual HTTP requests.

Once created, the data can be explored in the browser using a query
such as `MATCH (p:Person {user_id:1}) RETURN p`.
